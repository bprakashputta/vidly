## Middlewares
    1. express.json() - converts the JSON object received in request to request.body
    2. express.urlencoded() - converts Fields/Parameters received in Request to request.body
    3. express.static('public') - serves static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files

    Types of Middleware
        1. Applied on routes
            
            app.use(function(req, res, next)) {
                // ...     
                next(); 
            }

        2. Applied on routes starting with /api/admin
            
            app.use(‘/api/admin’, function(req, res, next)) {
                // ...     
                next(); 
            }

## Configurations and Environment Variables
We can detect the environment in which our Node application is running (development, production, etc) using `process.env.NODE_ENV` and `app.get(‘env’)`.


    1. NPM RC - most popular configuration manager that we use for managing multiple environments, 
                like different databases for development and production environments 
    
    2. NPM CONFIG - My preferred configuration manager that we use for managing multiple environments, 
                like different databases for development and production environments

Setting Environment variables on different systems as follows:-\
   1. WINDOWS

    $env:NODE_ENV="production"


   2. UNIX/MAC/LINUX
    
    export process.env.NODE_ENV="production"

### Note
    While Checking config files to repository, do not write usernames, passwords, and server details
    in to the public repository

## Debug
1. debug - `npm i debug` to install the debug package
   
2. Import the package into the code

        const startupDebugger = require('debug')('vidly::startup')
        const dbDebugger = require('debug')('vidly::db')

3. Now, export the debug namespaces to environment variables,

       export DEBUG=vidly:server,vidly:app,vidly:route
                  or
       export DEBUG=*


This package can be used instead of console.log statement, enable or disable it depending
development environment type


## Template Engine
There are many template engines, most popular among them are `pug`, `mustache`, `ejs`. We will be 
using `pug` template engine in this project. 
   1. Setup Template Engine in `server.js`
   
          vidly.set('view engine', 'pug');
          vidly.set('views', './views');

   ### PUG
   `PUG` is a very popular template engine for parsing dynamic HTML content to the browser,
   it's different from the other two template engines by the syntax. `PUG` has very simple 
   HTML like syntax without tags.
      
         html
            head
               title= titleName
            body
               header= headerName
               nav= navBar
   
   **Note:-** The equal to symbol should right beside the tag it is associated with            
   

## Database Integration
    
We are using `MongoDB` for this application. `NodeJs` has `MongoClient` and `Mongoose` libraries
for integrating database and backend. 
    
        const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient

        MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/animals', function(err,db){
            if(err) throw err
        }
